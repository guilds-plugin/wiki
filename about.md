## Open-Source Team

This project could not have been created with the constant help of others in the community that are also inspired to help create an awesome RPG community on servers!

## Special Thanks

A special thanks to our friends at Jetbrains for providing us with the tools that help us provide you these awesome updates with all their developer tools.

## Credits

The Guilds Project is a completely open source project so we'd like to give thanks to a number of libraries that we use in order to make the plugin function as it does.
