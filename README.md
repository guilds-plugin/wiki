# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/logo.png)

Guilds was created to offer an RPG-type system to servers. It was inspired by players like you who enjoy creating a fun, exciting, and adventurous environment for your server. Guilds allow players to join interactive groups of other players, make their own communities on your server, and have a general fun time!

## Supported Platforms

The project supports a variety of platforms with more to come in the future.

Our core platforms that we support include the following:

* Bukkit
* Spigot
* Paper

## Getting Support

There are multiple ways to get support including help from me and others in the community Discord.

While I might have the answers to most questions, you should try a few steps before coming to me.

1. The Wiki

Please try and make use of the Wiki! I constantly put time into updating it in hopes that it will answer all your questions

1. The Community Discord

The Guild's Community Discord is full of awesome people who might be able to help you out with your issue!

To get to the Community Discord, you can either click [me](https://glaremasters.me/discord) or click the link in the top bar!



## Reporting Bugs & Issues

We all know bugs are never fun. The Guilds Project is a fairly big plugin so we ask that if you experience a bug or an issue to please confirm that it is actually caused by us and not by other plugin that might be conflicting with it.

If you have confirmed that there is a bug and would like to report it, you may do so by filling out a report [here](https://github.com/guilds-plugin/Guilds/issues/new/choose)
