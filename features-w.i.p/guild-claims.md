# Guild Claims

The claiming system in Guilds utilizes WorldGuard. It's 100% optional. You can have users claim their own land, a single cuboid region, and choose which roles in the Guild can perform different actions such as: opening chests, placing blocks, and breaking blocks! There's so much to do with this, all you have to do is customize it to your heart's desire. 

Don't want to use our built-in claims? That's okay! The plugin is designed to be able to work with most popular claiming plugins that are out there.
