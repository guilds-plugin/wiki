# Guild Vaults

This feature was one that took a lot of time to create. Think of this like PlayerVaults, but for Guilds. Each Guild has multiple vaults \(inventories\) that they can store items in. Utilizing Guild Roles, you can specify who can modify the vaults! One thing that's cool is that you don't just have one vault, you can have as many as you want! You can utilize the tier system to decide how many vaults each tier should have!
