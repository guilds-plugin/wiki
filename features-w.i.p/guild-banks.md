# Guild Banks

The banking system in Guilds is just like any other kind of bank you would think of. Each Guild has their own bank and they can all contribute to it along with take money out of it. Using the Guild Roles, you can specify which roles can deposit money and which roles can take money out! Money can be used on things such as leveling up the Guild's tier and buying buffs!
