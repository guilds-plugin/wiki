# The Arena System

Hey there,

Guilds is proud to present to you the new War Arena System that will be coming in v3.5.2.

This update is **SO MASSIVE** that I've decided to put the update logs in a single place so that we can avoid any confusion.

In order to help you guys learn about what all has changed, each new major part of the update will have a video and a text-version to tell you about everything!

## New Wiki

Before I get into that, you might also notice we use a new software for the wiki! Thank you so much GitBook for assisting me in moving over from my old software and graciously providing this for us to use.

Now, let's get into the fun stuff of this update.

## **Arenas**

The arenas by themselves are a massive implementation into the plugin. As a server owner, you will be able to create your own arenas, along with setting the spawn points for each team! Watch the video below to get a better idea of how to manage your arenas.

#### New Commands

* /guild arena set challenger &lt;arena&gt;
* /guild arena create &lt;name&gt;
* /guild arena set defender &lt;arena&gt;
* /guild arena delete &lt;arena&gt;
* /guild arena list
* /guild arena tp &lt;arena&gt; &lt;challenger/defender&gt;

#### Understanding

The new arena system is fairly easy to understand. As an admin of the server, you can create new arenas, set the spawn points for them, teleport to them, list the arenas, and delete the arenas as you see fit.

You have full control of what the arena is and where the team spawn.
