# The Arena System

Hey there,

Guilds is proud to present to you the new War Arena System that will be coming in v3.5.2.

This update is **SO MASSIVE** that I've decided to put the update logs in a single place so that we can avoid any confusion.

## New Wiki

Before I get into that, you might also notice we use a new software for the wiki! Thank you so much GitBook for assisting me in moving over from my old software and graciously providing this for us to use.

Now, let's get into the fun stuff of this update.

## **Arenas**

The arenas by themselves are a massive implementation into the plugin. As a server owner, you will be able to create your own arenas, along with setting the spawn points for each team! Watch the video below to get a better idea of how to manage your arenas.
